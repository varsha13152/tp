### 3.3 How to use InnSync features:
InnSync operates mainly through CLI commands. Before exploring to the specific features in details under
the feature section. Let's try to familiarize ourselves with the basic components and formats to execute a command.
> **Tip:** All the command words are case-sensitive!
>
> * `add` is different from `Add`
> *
#### 3.3.1 Parameter Prefixes:

In InnSync, a parameter prefix acts as a delimiter for specifying different types of parameters in commands.
Here's a reference table for common parameter prefixes and their corresponding parameters:

| Parameter Prefix | Corresponding Parameter |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| `n/`             | `NAME`                  |

| `t/`             | `TAG`                   |

#### 3.3.2 Parameters:

**Example:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]`
>**Tip:** You can add a guest without specifying a tag!

**Structure of Command:**<br>

|         | Component        | Description                                            |

| `n/`    | Parameter Prefix | Unique prefix to distinguish `NAME` from other prefix. |
| `NAME`  | Parameter        | Represents placeholder for name of the guest.          |


**General Notes about InnSync:**<br>

> **A command can be categorized into three formats:**
> 1. `COMMAND` + `INDEX`
> 2. `COMMAND` + `PARAMETER_PREFIX` + `PARAMETER`
> 3. `COMMAND` + `INDEX` + `PARAMETER_PREFIX` + `PARAMETER`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Format: `find [n/]KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] | p/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] | e/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] | a/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] | t/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] | m/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] | bd/DATE [MORE_DATES] | bp/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

#### Search Modes:


| Prefix | Field            | Description                                  | Example                    |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| (none) or `n/` | Name     | Searches through contact names              | `find John` or `find n/John` |
| `p/`    | Phone           | Searches through phone numbers               | `find p/9123`              |
| `e/`    | Email           | Searches through email addresses             | `find e/@example.com`      |
| `a/`    | Address         | Searches through addresses                   | `find a/Clementi`          |
| `t/`    | Tag             | Searches through contact tags                | `find t/friend`            |

| `bp/`   | Booking Property | Searches for contacts with bookings at the specified property | `find bp/BeachHouse` |


#### Search Behavior:

* **Case-insensitive** - Search is not affected by upper or lower case (e.g., `find john` matches `John Doe`)
* **Order-independent** - The order of keywords doesn't matter (e.g., `find Bo Hans` matches `Hans Bo`)
* **Partial matching** - Keywords are matched partially against fields (e.g., `find Jo` matches `John`)

* **Multiple fields**:
  * Different search field types can be combined (e.g., `find n/John t/friend`)
  * When multiple field types are specified, only contacts matching ALL specified fields are returned (e.g., `find n/John t/friend` returns contacts named John who are also tagged as friend)

* **Multiple keywords**:
  * Multiple search terms can be provided for any field type
  * When multiple keywords are provided for the same field, contacts matching ANY of those keywords are returned (e.g., `find John Jane` returns contacts with either "John" or "Jane" in their name)

#### Special Notes for Booking Searches:

* Dates must be in the `yyyy-MM-dd` format (e.g., `2025-01-01` for January 1, 2025)
* A contact is matched if the specified date falls within the booking's start and end dates
* Multiple dates can be specified to find contacts with bookings during any of those dates
* Booking property searches match property names partially (e.g., `find bp/Beach` matches `BeachHouse`)

#### Examples:

**Searching by name:**
* `find John` - Finds contacts with "John" in their name
* `find alex david` - Finds contacts with either "alex" or "david" in their name

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

## 6. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
