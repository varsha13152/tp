the feature section. Let's try to familiarize ourselves with the basic components and formats to execute a command.
> **Tip:** All the command words are case-sensitive!
>
> * `add` is different from `Add`

#### 3.3.1 Parameter Prefixes:

In InnSync, a parameter prefix acts as a delimiter for specifying different types of parameters in commands.
Here's a reference table for parameter prefixes and their corresponding parameters:

| Parameter Prefix | Corresponding Parameter  |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| `n/`             | `NAME`                   |
| `p/`             | `PHONE`                  |
| `e/`             | `EMAIL`                  |
| `a/`             | `ADDRESS`                |

#### 3.3.2 Parameters:

In InnSync, a parameter represents a placeholder where users input data.
Parameters typically follow immediately after their corresponding Parameter Prefixes.
Essentially, they are to be supplied by the user.

**Note:** All user inputs, including parameters, will be trimmed (all leading and trailing whitespaces will be ignored).

| Parameter          | Prefix   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `NAME`             | `n/`     | Specifies the name of a visitor.<br><br>**Requirements:**<ul></li><li>Names cannot be empty.</li><li>Names cannot exceed 170 characters.</li><li>Names with only whitespace are not allowed.</li><li>In this system, names can contain any characters except ```$```, including prefixes like ```a/``` or ```e/```. However, names containing prefixes, such as ```murthu a/p vara``` must be preceded by a ```$``` to avoid the prefix being interpreted as one.<li> **For example:**<ul><li>```n/Muthu a/p vara``` → Name: Muthu, Address: p vara <li>```n/Muthu $a/p vara``` → Name: Muthu a/p vara (entire string is parsed as the name, and ```$a/p``` is ignored as a prefix) <li>The ```$``` is used to prevent the parser from treating the following string as a prefix — it tells the parser "don't treat this as a field, treat it as part of the value."</ul><li>You are unable to add names containing ```$```, as it is used for the purpose mentioned above. All ```$``` characters found in name parameters will be excluded from the contact's display name. |

#### 3.3.3 Command Format:

To understand how a full command is interpreted, we will utilise the following example.

**Example:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG...] [b/BOOKING_TAG...] [r/REQUEST...]`
>**Tip:** You can add a visitor without specifying a tag, booking tag and request and that is why it has a bracket around it!

**Structure of Command:**<br>

|         | Component        | Description                                            |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `add`   | Command          | Executes Add Command to add a visitor.                 |
| `n/`    | Parameter Prefix | Unique prefix to distinguish `NAME` from other prefix. |
| `NAME`  | Parameter        | Represents placeholder for name of the visitor.        |

**General Notes about InnSync:**<br>

> **A command can be categorized into three formats:**
> 1. `COMMAND` + `INDEX`
> 2. `COMMAND` + `PARAMETER_PREFIX` + `PARAMETER`
> 3. `COMMAND` + `INDEX` + `PARAMETER_PREFIX` + `PARAMETER`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
e.g. `[t/TAG...]` can be used as ` `&nbsp;(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

to enable you to search for names containing prefixes, i.e. find a contact whose name contains "murthu a/p" - `find n/murthu $a/p`.

## 6. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
